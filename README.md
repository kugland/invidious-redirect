# Invidious Redirect

This userscript redirects YouTube videos to an Invidious instance. It was created by Andr√© Kugland.

## Usage

To use this script, you'll need a userscript manager like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey. Once the script is installed, it will automatically redirect YouTube videos to your Invidious instance when you click on a YouTube link. By default, the script is configured to redirect to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`, but you can change this by editing the `makeUrl` function in the script.
